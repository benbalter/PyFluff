Furby is a trademark of Hasbro. This project is not affiliated with Hasbro in
ANY WAY. It is purely for educational purposes and to allow technically minded owners of Furby Connect 
edition toys to be able to control their devices over Bluetooth now that the manufacturer
has removed support for the associated Bluetooth control application. The Furby Connect
edition toy and associated sofwtare are no longer supported by Hasbro so please don't contact them for support
with this project.  All rights reserved to their respective owners.

All reverse engineering of the Furby Connect edition Bluetooth protocol was done by the Bluefluff
community. Please see the original Bluefluff project for more information https://github.com/Jeija/bluefluff.
This project stands entirely on the shoulders of those diminutive giants.
